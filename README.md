# topic-models-demo

Demonstration of a standard topic model approach. I started this a long time
ago, but then abandoned this for a while.  The main piece is the html doc, but
there are a couple scripts for further demo also.  The focus is on the
underlying data generating model and inclusion of covariates that influence
topic prevalence, as opposed to just using package functions to get a result.
